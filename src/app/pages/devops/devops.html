        <h3>DevOps SERVICES</h3>
        <p>
          DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to
          improve collaboration and efficiency. It focuses on automating processes such as building,
          testing, and deploying applications. DevOps helps organizations deliver software faster
          and more reliably. It encourages continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
          Monitoring and feedback are used to improve system performance and stability. Overall,
          DevOps enables faster innovation with better quality and reduced risk.
