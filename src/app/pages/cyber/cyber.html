      <h4>Hardware cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>
        As hardware becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, securing it is no longer
        optional—it’s essential. The convergence of Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs), Fault Injection,
        and Supply Chain Attacks highlights the rising complexity of modern threats. To ensure the
        integrity, confidentiality, and availability of critical devices, a proactive approach that
        incorporates advanced testing methodologies and hardware-based defences is crucial.

      <h4>Secure coding testing</h4>
      <p>
        By incorporating these secure coding techniques into your software development process, you
        can significantly strengthen the security of your applications and defend them against
        evolving cybersecurity threats. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and remaining
        vigilant and proactive is essential for safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of
        your software and data.

      <h4>Mission-critial embedded system</h4>
      <p>
        Post implementation of redundant boot mechanism, system reliability metrics could be derived
        partly from pre-launch stress tests, from both non-destructive means like artificially
        corrupted normal bootable images, as well as from limited destructive tests, like
        physical/electrical damage to normal boot device. The metrics could also be partly derived
        from field failure data during the initial pilot deployments, with the help of low-level
        logs of boot failures and user assisted recovery. Therefore, redundant boot for embedded
        systems is one of the mechanisms that improves system availability in the event of boot
        failure in the field, thereby improving the security of mission critical applications..
